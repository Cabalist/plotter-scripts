Random Plotter scripts for HP7440A

# Software Installation
Unfortunately, non-Linux/BSD systems are not well supported as we are using a Prolific 2303 USB-to-serial converter. Mac users may need to muck with kernel extensions. Windows users may be able to download a driver from [Prolific's website]. But after the appropriate drivers are installed, our scripts require [pyserial] and [numpy].
